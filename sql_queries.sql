-- Query 1:
-- Add an extra column ‘Late’ to the Book_Loan table. Values will be 0-for non-late retuns, and 1-for late

-- due date and with '0' for those were returned on time.

-- Query 2:
-- Add an extra column ‘LateFee’ to the Library_Branch table, decide late fee per day for each branch and 
-- update that column.
-- Query 2 Solver:

-- following attributes:  
--    • Card_No,  
--    • Borrower Name 
--    • Date_Out,  
--    • Due_Date,  
--    • Returned_date  
--    • Total Days of book loaned out as 'TotalDays'– you need to change weeks to days  
--    • Book Title
