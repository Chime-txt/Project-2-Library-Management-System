-- Question 1: Insert yourself as a New Borrower. Do not provide the Card_no in your query.
-- Question 1 Solver: Chime Nguyen
-- Borrower has Card_No, Name, Address, Phone, we will only be using the latter three attributes.
-- Since Card_No is a primary key, it will auto increment as necessary

-- Question 4-a: Insert a new BOOK with the following info: Title: 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' ; 
-- Book_author: 'J.K. Rowling' ; Publisher_name: 'Oxford Publisheing'
-- Question 4-a Solver: Trung Nguyen & Chime Nguyen

-- Query 1:
-- Add an extra column 'Late' to the Book_Loan table. Values will be 0-for non-late retuns, and 1-for late 
-- returns. Then update the 'Late' column with '1' for all records that they have a return date later than the
-- due date and with '0' for those were returned on time.
-- Query 1 Solver: Ivan Ko
-- This query does not account for books that weren't turned in at all, so we should mark this column as
-- non-late
